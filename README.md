# GDS-final-project
Repository for ISA Green Data Science final projects

> Assessment directions:
Create a GitHub (public) repository for your project (one single repository for the group) .
Create a README.md text file that explains your project. This file should include your Project
title, and a description of your project.

>When any user clones the repository and executes project.py in a local machine, after pip-
installing the packages listed in requirements.txt, the execution should run with no errors and produce the expected output(s).
Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should explain
what your project is, what each of the files you wrote for the project contains and does, and if
you debated certain design choices, explaining why you made them. Ensure you allocate
sufficient time and energy to writing a README.md that documents your project thoroughly.
